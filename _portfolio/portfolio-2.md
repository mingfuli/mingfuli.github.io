Grandma Green is a 2D simulation game developed by a team of ~20 USC students. Currently, the game is in the beta stage. I am the Gameplay AI Engineer in the team, where I mainly worked on the AI system of our plant friends. I also supported the development of our player character control and NPC interactions.

* The Golem system which includes golems spawning, evolution, and emotion handling. Golems start out as a Baby, and evolve into a Grown-up when they max out their happiness meter. Players can assign task to a Grown-up can golems to help building their garden.  
* I developed and provided the emotion and exressions handling APIs to other engineers in the team. The APIs follows Publish‚Äìsubscribe pattern. My engineering peers, who worked for UI and dialogue, can easily update a golem's emotion and expression in a decoupling and elegant manner.

### Driven by Behavior Tree

### Building Our Character Pipeline
Working closely with our artists, I help build our 2d character pipeline. Our game has a variety of lovely characters including Grandma, Shopkeepers, and Golems. responsible for managing the entire pipeline or for overseeing specific stages of the process. from import, rigging, animation all the way to scripting.
