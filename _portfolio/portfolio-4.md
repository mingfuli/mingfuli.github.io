Precious Stones is a 3D action-adventure game developed by a team of 6. I am one of the two Engineers in the team and collaborate with four composors from Berklee College of Music. Players play as a dwarf who starts an adventure following his father’s wishes and uses his beloved hammer to defeat monsters and solve interesting puzzles.
