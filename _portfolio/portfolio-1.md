Farlight 84 is a shooter game developed by Liliths Games using Unreal Engine 4. The game launch on mobile in 2022 and will launch on PC soon. I worked as Game Client Engineer Intern in the team from May 2022 to Aug 2022. During my internship, I worked on live content support, including weapon inventory and custom match room.
