Farlight 84 is a shooter game developed and published by Lilith Games. The game launched in selected regions in 2022 and launched globally this year. I was a Game Client Engineer Intern in the team. During my internship, I mainly worked on live content support.

### Weapon Inventory

* Collabrating with our UI/UX designers, I implemented the logic of our new weapon inventory design. 
* I developed multiple new features for weapons and their skins which are on sale or available in live events. For instance, I iterated the sorting rules for the weapon inventory.

### Custom Match Lobby

* Farlight 84 had offered players options to create their own customized matches. In this new version, the team also introduced tournaments in this module, so we needed to incorporate new features in this legacy system. 
* Cooperated with our server engineers, I implmented and tested APIs in this module. I was responsible for updating sorting and filtering rules and developing the searching feature for customized matches and tournament matches.
